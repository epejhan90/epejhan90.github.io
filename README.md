I’m Elham, a guest visitor student in the Machine Learning Section at the University of Copenhagen, where I’m a member of the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) NLP group under the supervision of Desmond Elliott.My interest is multimodal machine learning at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision. My recent work includes text-to-image generation to generate images based on the related text using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
